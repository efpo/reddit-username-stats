      "text": "Yes. I couldn't help but feel that it was disrespectful of him. He ignored that I make so much efforts trying to make him a veriety of sandwiches. And taking time at night to prepare everything. Not to mention going to the grocery store and buying the things he prefers. He makes about 15$ a day by selling sandwiches and goes to buy his lunch from the restaurant. He said I shouldn't feel mad since he's making his own money to buy his own lunch. But I'm not accepting what he did. I'm hurt and I wish he understood how I felt."
